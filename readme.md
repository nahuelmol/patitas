<h3>Introduction</h3>

The backend going to have a matcher system, which will compares each lost animal witha database. This way animals can be founded more rapidly.
That is a first look of the project

<h4>Tests</h4>

Inside of each app is a **test** folder that contains all the test functions over the same app.

For all apps

```
python manage.py test
```
For each one

```
python manage.py test <app_name>/<test_folder_name>
```

<h3>Purpose</h3>
Mainly, to build a fullstack project:

 - develop backend and frontend sparately 
 - state a connection through http request using axios library

<h3>Motivation</h3>
To find street animals:

- keep connected a community in favor of a colaboratively work finding home for those animals 
- awareness, to teach how responsible they owners are of their pets

Maintain order in animals population 

<h3>Future</h3>
The future is to carry out a web microservice, separated crontend from the backend.
Soon integrate ReactJs or another fontend framework. I'd adopt a tool like Vuejs as more fastest way to work. However, this frontend development is taking much time due to my unexperiemce in that field of web development.

<p>I have decided to build two systems with the same backend, one of those implement a microservice methodolgy and the other one is all in one, including Django's templates</p>
